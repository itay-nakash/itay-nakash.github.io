Hey there!
I’m Itay Nakash, an AI Research Scientist at IBM.

I’m interested in safe AI and LLM-based agent security. My work focuses on developing and evaluating the safety of AI models, particularly in real-world scenarios where they autonomously take actions on behalf of users.

Feel free to connect if you'd like to discuss AI safety, security, or any exciting developments in tech!
