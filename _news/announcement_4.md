📄 Our new paper, *“Breaking ReAct Agents: Foot-in-the-Door Attack Will Get You In”*, has been accepted to NAACL 2025 and will be presented at the conference!
This work focuses on red-teaming LLM-based AI agents, examining vulnerabilities in autonomous systems and exploring how they can be both exploited and safeguarded. You can find the paper [here](https://itay-nakash.github.io/fitd/).
