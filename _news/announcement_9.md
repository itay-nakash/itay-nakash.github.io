ðŸ“„ Our paper *Effective Red-Teaming of Policy-Adherent Agents* is out!
We introduce **CRAFT** â€” a multi-agent red-teaming system that **exposes hidden vulnerabilities** in agents designed to follow strict policies (like flight refunds & return rules).
We also release **Ï„-break**, a new benchmark for evaluating agent **security** in policy-adherence domains.
